# Playwright Automation – Assignment 1

## Student Information
- Student ID: IT23646810  
- Assignment: Assignment 1 – Test Automation  
- Option Selected: Option 1 (Playwright)

## Git Repository
This repository is publicly accessible and contains the complete Playwright project:  
https://github.com/wenushiwijerathna/IT23646810-ITPM-Assignment-1.git

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic test automation using Playwright. The test cases were first designed and documented in an Excel sheet, and selected scenarios were automated using Playwright. The system under test is a **Singlish to Sinhala translation web application (SwiftTranslator).**

## Tools and Technologies Used
Node.js, Playwright, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code.

## Test Types Covered
Positive Functional Test, Negative Functional Test (conceptual mapping), and UI Test (real-time output behavior).

## Installation and How to Run the Tests
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if not already installed.  
2. Clone the repository and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wenushiwijerathna/IT23646810-ITPM-Assignment-1.git
   cd IT23646810-ITPM-Assignment-1
